# In this folder ...

In this directory, you'll find a variety of musical productions. They were ALL produced by MOzART. The productions always start with a few seconds (between 3 and 20 seconds) of prompt from the test set, and the rest of the song is generated by the transformer.

The `unfiltered` folder contains all kinds of productions, so we haven't made any selection. They allow us to understand the progression of the models over the epochs. 

The `filtered` folder contains productions that we have carefully selected. They demonstrate the musical possibilities offered by MOzART.  The starting prompts were not part of the training set.

The files are formatted as follows `x.y.mid` where `x` is the version of MOzART used (as presented in the article) and `y` is a unique identifier for the production. In the unfiltered folder, this identifier corresponds to the number of gradient descent steps performed since the model was created. 

# Approximate start prompts length:
