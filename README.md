# INFO8010---MOZART---Generating-Music-with-Transformers
As part of the info8010 - DEEP-LEARNING course taught by Gilles Louppe at the University of Li√®ge, we built a series of transformers for generating music in MIDI format as a personal group project (3 students).  We provide here the different codes and also the results we were able to obtain.

To make our project memorable, we named it MOzART (Musical Orchestra z Artificial Rhapsody Transformer).

## Datasets

We've decided not to share the datasets used - even though we explain exactly how they were generated in our article - since they contain musical productions that are not free of copyright. We used these productions as part of an academic project, but we believe that artists deserve to obtain the results (financial and in terms of visibility) linked to their production. Downloading or listening to them via illegal platforms does not remunerate artists.
