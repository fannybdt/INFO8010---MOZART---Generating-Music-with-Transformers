# INFO8010---MOZART---Generating-Music-with-Transformers
As part of the info8010 - DEEP-LEARNING course taught by Gilles Louppe at the University of Li√®ge, we built a series of transformers for generating music in MIDI format as a personal group project (3 students).  We provide here the different codes and also the results we were able to obtain.
